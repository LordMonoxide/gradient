### Notes
* All vanilla tools are disabled
* You can not break blocks harder than 1.0f (AT ALL) without the correct tool (ie. you can still dig dirt, sand, etc.)
* You can craft 3x3 in your inventory

### Getting started
* Gather up fibre from grass
* Gather up pebbles (you'll find them randomly on the ground, might have to look around a bit)
* Gather sticks by breaking leaves
* Craft a hammer (1 pebble, 1 fibre, 1 stick, in a column), a very basic mining tool
* Craft a mattock (1 fibre and 1 stick like the hammer, 2 pebbles on either side of the fibre), for farming, chopping wood, and fighting
* Split up some logs into planks with the mattock (shapeless, crafting grid)
* Craft a fire pit with 5 sticks (shapeless) and place it on the ground
* Load it up with a bit of fibre and sticks
* Craft a fire starter with 2 sticks and a fibre (shapeless) and right click on the fire pit to light it
* Load logs or planks into the fire pit and cook some food
