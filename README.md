# Gradient

### Notes
* All vanilla tools are disabled
* You can not break blocks harder than 1.0f (AT ALL) without the correct tool (ie. you can still dig dirt, sand, etc)

### Getting started
* Gather up fibre from grass
* Gather up pebbles (you'll find them randomly on the ground, might have to look around a bit)
* Gather sticks by breaking leaves
* You can craft 3x3 in your inventory. Craft a hammer (1 pebble, 1 fibre, 1 stick, in a column)
