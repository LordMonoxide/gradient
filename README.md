# Gradient

### Notes
* All vanilla tools are disabled
* You can not break blocks harder than 1.0f (AT ALL) without the correct tool (ie. you can still dig dirt, sand, etc)

### Getting started
* Gather up fibre from grass
* Gather up pebbles (you'll find them randomly on the ground, might have to look around a bit)
